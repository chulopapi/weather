Weather Dashboard

Project Name: Weather Dashboard

This program is published at the following website: https://chulopapi.github.io/weather/

Github Reposatory: https://github.com/chulopapi/weather


This Application creates a simple weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.  I will use localStorage to store persistent data.

For this project I was asked to use OpenWeather API links to retrieve weather for local cities or any city in entire world.  

USER STORY: This program should provide a weather outlook for multiple cities, to help a traveler to plan a trip.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Provide a weather dashboard with a form input.  It also display a list of the past cities and you can go back to review the city history.

2. Once input the name of the city, I am presented with the current condition for that city as well as the view of the current weather conditions.  It also presents the 5 day forecast, showing the date of the week, an icon that represents the weather conditions, the temperature and teh humidity.
